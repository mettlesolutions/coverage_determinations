Coverage:

1)The patient has been diagnosed as having diabetes;
2)The patient’s physician states that the patient is capable of being trained to use the particular device prescribed in an appropriate manner. In some cases, the patient may not be able to perform this function, but a responsible individual can be trained to use the equipment and monitor the patient to assure that the intended effect is achieved. This is permissible if the record is properly documented by the patient’s physician; and
3)The device is designed for home rather than clinical use.
4)There is also a blood glucose monitoring system designed especially for use by those with visual impairments.

These special blood glucose monitoring systems are covered under Medicare if the following conditions are met:

1)The patient and device meet the three conditions listed above for coverage of standard home blood glucose monitors; and
2)The patient's physician certifies that he or she has a visual impairment severe enough to require use of this special monitoring system.
