//Heartsbreath Test for Heart Transplant Rejection

Not Covered:

Effective for services performed on or after December 8, 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has determined that the evidence does not adequately define the technical characteristics of the test nor demonstrate that Heartsbreath testing to predict heart transplant rejection improves health outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries. Thus, we conclude that the Heartsbreath test is not reasonable and necessary under section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act and is non-covered.
