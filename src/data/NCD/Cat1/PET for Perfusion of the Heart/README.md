PET for Perfusion of the Heart

PET scans performed at rest or with pharmacological stress used for noninvasive imaging of the perfusion of the heart for the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease using the FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical Rubidium 82 (Rb 82) 

RB-82
The PET scan, whether at rest alone, or rest with stress,
=>not addition of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
=>following a SPECT that was found to be inconclusive. PET scan must have been considered necessary in order to determine what medical or surgical intervention is required to treat the patient.(inconclusive test )
=>The claimant must submit additional specified information on the claim form , to indicate the results of the PET scan. The claimant must also include information on whether the PET scan was performed after an inconclusive noninvasive cardiac test.
