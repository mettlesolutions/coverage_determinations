////Gamma Glutamyl Transferase

Indications

=>To provide information about known or suspected hepatobiliary disease, for example:
	-Following chronic alcohol or drug ingestion.
	-Following exposure to hepatotoxins.
	-When using medication known to have a potential for causing liver toxicity (e.g., following the drug manufacturer's recommendations).
	-Following infection (e.g., viral hepatitis and other specific infections such as amoebiasis, tuberculosis, psittacosis, and similar 			infections).
=>liver injury/function following diagnosis of primary or secondary malignant neoplasms.
 =>liver injury/function in a wide variety of disorders and diseases known to cause liver involvement (e.g., diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, disorders of iron and mineral metabolism, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lupus, and hypertension).
=>liver function related to gastrointestinal disease.
=>liver function related to pancreatic disease.
=>liver function in patients subsequent to liver transplantation.
=>To differentiate between the different sources of elevated alkaline phosphatase activity.

Limitations

=>liver dysfunction secondary to existing non-hepatobiliary disease with no change in signs, symptoms, or treatment, it is generally not necessary to repeat a GGT determination after a normal result has been obtained unless new indications are present.
=>If the GGT is the only "liver" enzyme abnormally high, it is generally not necessary to pursue further evaluation for liver disease for this specific indication.
=>When used to determine if other abnormal enzyme tests reflect liver abnormality rather than other tissue, it generally is not necessary to repeat a GGT more than one time per week.
=>Because of the extreme sensitivity of GGT as a marker for cytochrome oxidase induction or cell membrane permeability, it is generally not useful in monitoring patients with known liver disease.
