//Electroencephalographic Monitoring During Surgical Procedures Involving the Cerebral Vasculature

Indications
=>general anesthesia 
=>Very characteristic changes in the EEG occur when cerebral perfusion is inadequate for cerebral function.
=>cerebral perfusion requires the expertise of an electroencephalographer, a neurologist trained in EEG, or an advanced EEG technician for its proper interpretation.

=>carotid endarterectomies and in other neurological procedures where cerebral perfusion could be reduced.Such other procedures might include aneurysm surgery where hypotensive anesthesia is used or other cerebral vascular procedures where cerebral blood flow may be interrupted.
