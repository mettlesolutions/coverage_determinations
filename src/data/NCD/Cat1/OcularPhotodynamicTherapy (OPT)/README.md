//Ocular Photodynamic Therapy (OPT)

Covered;
=> OPT with verteporfin continues to be approved for a diagnosis of neovascular AMD with predominately classic subfoveal CNV lesions (where the area of classic CNV occupies ≥ 50% of the area of the entire lesion) at the initial visit as determined by an FA.
=>Subsequent follow-up visits require either an optical coherence tomography (OCT) (effective April 3. 2013) or an FA (effective April 1, 2004) to access treatment response
=>There are no requirements regarding visual acuity, lesion size, and number of re-treatments when treating predominantly classic lesions.

 =>OPT with verteporfin is reasonable and necessary for treating:

1)Subfoveal occult with no classic CNV associated with AMD; and,
2)Subfoveal minimally classic CNV (where the area of classic CNV occupies < 50% of the area of the entire lesion)associated with AMD.

=>above 2 indications are considered reasonable and necessary only when:

1)The lesions are small (4 disk areas or less in size) at the time of initial treatment or within the 3 months prior to initial treatment; and,
2)The lesions have shown evidence of progression within the 3 months prior to initial treatment. Evidence of progression must be documented by deterioration of visual acuity (at least 5 letters on a standard eye examination chart), lesion growth (an increase in at least 1 disk area), or the appearance of blood associated with the lesion.


Not Covered:
1)Juxtafoveal or extrafoveal CNV lesions (lesions outside the fovea),
2)Inability to obtain a fluorescein angiogram,
3)Atrophic or “dry” AMD.

Others:
OPT with verteporfin for other ocular indications, such as pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome
