Patients would have to meet the following additional selection guidelines:

=>An ejection fraction of 25% or greater;
=>Have areas of viable ischemic myocardium  which are not capable of being revascularized by direct coronary intervention, severe ventricular arrhythmias, decompensated congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction.
