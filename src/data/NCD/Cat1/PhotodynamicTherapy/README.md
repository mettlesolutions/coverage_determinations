Covered:
Only covered when used in conjunction with verteporfin

Classic Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascular (CNV) Lesions - OPT is covered with a diagnosis of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with predominately classic subfoveal choroidal neovascular (CNV) lesions (where the area of classic CNV occupies â‰¥ 50% of the area of the entire lesion) at the initial visit as determined by a fluorescein angiogram (FA). Subsequent follow-up visits will require either an optical coherence tomography or an FA to access treatment response. There are no requirements regarding visual acuity, lesion size, and number of re-treatments.

Occult Subfoveal CNV Lesions - OPT is non-covered for patients with a diagnosis of AMD with occult and no classic CNV lesions

Not Covered:
Use of OPT with verteporfin for other types of AMD(classic CNV lesions, atrophic, or dry AMD)

Other Conditions:
 pathologic myopia or presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome
