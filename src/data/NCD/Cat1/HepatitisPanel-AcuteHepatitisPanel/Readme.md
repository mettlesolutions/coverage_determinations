Indications

To detect viral hepatitis infection when there are abnormal liver function test results, with or without signs or symptoms of hepatitis.
Prior to and subsequent to liver transplantation.

Limitations

After a hepatitis diagnosis has been established, only individual tests, rather than the entire panel, are needed.
