Indications and Limitations of Coverage: 
The implantation of this device may be considered reasonable and necessary in specific clinical situations where a conventional valvuloplasty procedure is contraindicated. The implantation of an anti-gastroesophageal reflux device is covered only for patients with documented severe or life threatening gastroesophageal reflux disease whose conditions have been resistant to medical treatment and who also:

Have esophageal involvement with progressive systemic sclerosis; or
Have foreshortening of the esophagus such that insufficient tissue exists to permit a valve reconstruction; or
Are poor surgical risks for a valvuloplasty procedure; or
Have failed previous attempts at surgical treatment with valvuloplasty procedures.
