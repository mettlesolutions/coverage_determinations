# Tumor Antigen by Immunoassay - CA 125

Indications

=> epithelial ovarian carcinoma. 
=> carcinomas of the fallopian tube, endometrium, and endocervix.
=> malignant mesothelioma or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

A CA125 level may be obtained 
=>as part of the initial pre-operative work-up for women presenting with a suspicious pelvic mass to be used as a baseline for purposes of post-operative monitoring.
=> Initial declines in CA 125 after initial surgery and/or chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma are also measured by obtaining three serum levels during the first month post treatment to determine the patient's CA 125 half-life, which has significant prognostic implications.

=>completion of chemotherapy as an index of residual disease. Surveillance CA125 measurements are generally obtained every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter.
=> indicator of a patient's response to therapy in the presence of advanced or recurrent disease

Limitations

=> evaluation of patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of malignancy. The service may be ordered at times necessary to assess either the presence of recurrent disease or the patient's response to treatment with subsequent treatment cycles.

The CA 125 is specifically not covered for aiding in the differential diagnosis of patients with a pelvic mass as the sensitivity and specificity of the test is not sufficient. In general, a single "tumor marker" will suffice in following a patient with one of these malignancies.
