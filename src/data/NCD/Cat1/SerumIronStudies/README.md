# Serum Iron Studies
Issues: Need to find valuesets for
1)Oral or parenteral iron

/*Limitations:
1st point--> These tests are not to be used solely to assess acute phase reactants where disease management will be unchanged.For example, infections and malignancies are associated with elevations in acute phase reactants such as ferritin, and decreases in serum iron concentration, but iron studies would only be medically necessary if results of iron studies might alter the management of the primary diagnosis or might warrant direct treatment of an iron disorder or condition.

5th point--> If clinically indicated after evaluation of the initial iron studies, it may be appropriate to perform additional iron studies either on the initial specimen or on a subsequently obtained specimen.
