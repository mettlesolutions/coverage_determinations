Not Covered

=>The cosmetic surgery exclusion precludes payment for any surgical procedure directed at improving appearance. The condition giving rise to the patient's preoperative appearance is generally not a consideration. The only exception to the exclusion is of an accidental injury or for the improvement of a malformed body member which coincidentally serves some cosmetic purpose.
