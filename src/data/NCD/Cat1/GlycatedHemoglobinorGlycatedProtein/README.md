//Glycated Hemoglobin/Glycated Protein
Indications:
=>The management and control of diabetes. 
=> hyperglycemia, a history of hyperglycemia or dangerous hypoglycemia
=> Glycated protein testing may be used in place of glycated hemoglobin in the management of diabetic patients, and is particularly useful in patients who have abnormalities of erythrocytes such as hemolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathies.

Limitations:
It is not considered reasonable and necessary to perform
=> glycated hemoglobin tests more often than every three months on a controlled diabetic patient to determine whether the patient's metabolic control has been on average within the target range.
=> more frequently than once a month for diabetic pregnant women. 
=>Testing for uncontrolled type one or two diabetes mellitus may require testing more than four times a year. 
 provides the clinical basis for those situations in which testing more frequently than four times per annum is indicated, and medical necessity documentation must support such testing in excess of the above guidelines.

=> When the glycated hemoglobin assay is initially performed in these patients, the laboratory may inform the ordering physician of a possible analytical interference. Alternative testing, including glycated protein, for example, fructosamine, may be indicated for the monitoring of the degree of glycemic control in this situation. It is therefore conceivable that a patient will have both a glycated hemoglobin and glycated protein ordered on the same day.
