//Pharmacogenomic Testing for Warfarin Response

Covered:

pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness by any method, and is therefore covered only when provided to Medicare beneficiaries who are candidates for anticoagulation therapy with warfarin who:

1)Have not been previously tested for CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles; and
2)Have received fewer than five days of warfarin in the anticoagulation regimen for which the testing is ordered; and
3)Are enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study when that study meets the following standards.

=>warfarin therapy management includes pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin response, what is the frequency and severity of the following outcomes, compared to subjects whose warfarin therapy management does not include pharmacogenomic testing

1)Major hemorrhage
2)Minor hemorrhage
3)Thromboembolism related to the primary indication for anticoagulation
4)Other thromboembolic event
5)Mortality

Others:
does not determine coverage to identify CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles for other purposes, nor does it determine national coverage to identify other alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness.

Not Covered:
=> does not demonstrate that pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin
